<p><a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/ko-kr/" target="_blank" title="league of legends home page">League of Legends</a> is a 2009 multiplayer

<img src="lol.jpg"width="50%">
<p/><p style="margin-top:40px">In the game, two teams of five players battle
 in player versus player combat, each team occupying and defending their own half of the map.
 Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and
 differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful
 by collecting experience points and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team.
 In the game's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through
 to the enemy base and destroying their <strong><u>"nexus"</u></strong>,
 a large structure located within it.
